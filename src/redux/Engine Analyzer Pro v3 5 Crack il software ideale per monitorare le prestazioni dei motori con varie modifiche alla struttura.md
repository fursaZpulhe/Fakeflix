## Engine Analyzer Pro v3 5: Features and Benefits
  
Engine Analyzer Pro v3 5 has many features and benefits that make it a valuable tool for engine builders and engineers. Some of these features and benefits are:
  
- You can choose from hundreds of standard engine examples or create your own custom engine specifications. You can also import cam profiles from Cam Analyzer files or other sources[^1^] [^3^].
- You can simulate various types of superchargers, turbochargers, nitrous oxide injection, intercoolers, water injection, EGR, etc. You can also use full compressor maps to define the performance of turbocharger or centrifugal supercharger compressors[^1^] [^2^].
- You can perform detailed valve train dynamics calculations and see the effect of valve spring forces, valve train weights, cam profile, valve toss, pushrod force, etc. on performance. You can also design a system where a centrifugal supercharger feeds into a roots blower supercharger[^1^] [^2^].
- You can run chain calculations to compare multiple engine designs or modifications and find the best one for your application. You can also run part throttle performance maps to understand part throttle performance or calibrate electronic engine controllers[^1^] [^2^].
- You can print out graphs and reports of various engine parameters and customize them for your needs or add a company logo. You can also export data as ASCII files or email them as PDF files[^1^] [^4^] [^5^].
- You can view the combustion process, air flow past the valves, tuning pressure waves in the runners, power lost to friction or to the cooling system, etc. You can also add dyno power curves to compare actual dyno performance with simulated results[^1^] [^6^].

Engine Analyzer Pro v3 5 is a feature-rich and user-friendly program that can help you design and optimize your engine performance. It is a must-have tool for any serious engine builder or engineer.
