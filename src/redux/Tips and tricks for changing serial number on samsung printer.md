1. Find your current serial number using the HP Smart app. You can download it from [123.hp.com](https://123.hp.com) or your app store. Open the app and create an account or sign in. Then, tap your printer name and look for the serial number under Product Information[^2^].
2. Press the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) button on the printer control panel. This may reset some of the printer settings, including the serial number. Wait for a few minutes and then check the serial number again using the HP Smart app[^1^].
3. If the previous steps did not work, you may have to edit the registry of your Windows computer that is connected to the printer. This is a risky process that can damage your system if done incorrectly, so proceed with caution and back up your data before attempting it. Follow these steps to edit the registry[^3^]:
    1. Navigate your mouse cursor to your start menu, click it, then locate and select Run.
    2. Enter "Regedit" in the Open field, and then hit OK.
    3. Locate the registry "HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\WindowsNT\\Current Version\\WPAEvents" in the left pane and then select it.
    4. Right click on the OOBETimer in the right pane, and then select Modify.
    5. Change at least one digit of this value to deactivate Windows.
    6. Click OK and close the registry editor.
    7. Restart your computer.
    8. When you see the activation window, click Yes.
    9. Enter your new serial number and click Update.

If none of these steps worked for you, you may have to contact Samsung support for further assistance. You can find their contact information on their website: [https://www.samsung.com/us/support/](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/).

Changing the serial number on your Samsung printer may be necessary for various reasons, such as warranty claims, software updates, or compatibility issues. However, it is not a simple task and it may require some technical skills and knowledge. Therefore, you should only attempt it if you are confident and comfortable with the process. Otherwise, you may end up damaging your printer or your computer.
 
Before you change the serial number on your Samsung printer, you should also make sure that you have a valid and legal serial number that matches your printer model and region. You should not use a serial number that belongs to another device or that is pirated or stolen. Doing so may violate the terms and conditions of Samsung and result in legal consequences.
 
Finally, you should always keep a record of your original and new serial numbers in case you need to restore them or provide them to Samsung support. You can write them down on a piece of paper or store them in a secure digital location. This way, you can avoid any confusion or problems in the future.
