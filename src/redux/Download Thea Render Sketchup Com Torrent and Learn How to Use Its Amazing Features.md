By the end of September 2021, nine of its games had achieved the impressive feat of selling more than ten million copies worldwide. The best-selling game was Wii Sports, which came bundled with the console in most regions and sold a staggering 82.90 million units. It was followed by Mario Kart Wii, a racing game featuring Nintendo's iconic characters, which sold 37.38 million units. The third best-selling game was Wii Sports Resort, a sequel to Wii Sports that added more sports and activities, with 33.14 million units sold. Another popular game was New Super Mario Bros. Wii, a side-scrolling platformer that revived the classic Mario gameplay and allowed up to four players to cooperate or compete, selling 30.32 million units. Wii Play, a collection of mini-games that showcased the capabilities of the Wii Remote controller, sold 28.02 million units, partly because it also came with a controller in some regions. Wii Fit and Wii Fit Plus were fitness games that used a balance board accessory to measure the player's weight and posture, and offered various exercises and games to improve their health. They sold 22.67 million and 21.13 million units respectively. Super Smash Bros. Brawl was a fighting game that featured characters from various Nintendo franchises and other guest stars, and sold 13.32 million units. Finally, Super Mario Galaxy was a critically acclaimed 3D platformer that took Mario to outer space and introduced new gameplay mechanics based on gravity and planets. It sold 12.80 million units.[219] In total, the Wii had sold 921.85 million games by June 30, 2022.[220] Wii Sports was widely regarded as the main reason for the Wii's success, as it appealed to a broad audience that normally did not play video games and demonstrated the potential of the Wii's motion controls.[221]

The Wii console also had a strong library of games from third-party developers, who were initially skeptical of the Wii's unconventional design and audience, but later embraced its potential and creativity. Some of the most successful third-party games for the Wii included Just Dance, a rhythm game that used the Wii Remote to track the player's dance moves, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, a music game that used a guitar-shaped controller to simulate playing rock songs, Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition, an enhanced version of the acclaimed survival horror game that used the Wii Remote for aiming and shooting, and Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, a humorous action-adventure game that recreated the Star Wars movies with Lego characters and bricks.[222] Other notable third-party games for the Wii included Rayman Raving Rabbids, Sonic Colors, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Monster Hunter Tri, and Okami.[223]
  
The Wii console also had a number of features and services that enhanced its functionality and appeal. The Wii Menu was the main interface of the console, which allowed the user to access different channels such as the Mii Channel, where they could create and customize their own avatars, the Photo Channel, where they could view and edit their photos and videos, the News Channel and the Forecast Channel, where they could get updated information on current events and weather, and the Internet Channel, where they could browse the web using the Opera browser. The Wii also supported online gaming and connectivity through the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service, which enabled players to compete or cooperate with other players around the world in games such as Mario Kart Wii, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Animal Crossing: City Folk, and Wii Sports Resort. The Wii also had a built-in feature called WiiConnect24, which allowed the console to receive messages and updates from Nintendo and other users even when it was in standby mode.[224]
  
The Wii console was widely praised by critics and consumers for its innovation, accessibility, and fun factor. It won numerous awards and accolades from various media outlets and organizations, such as Time Magazine's Gadget of the Year in 2006,[225] IGN's Best Console of 2006,[226] GameSpot's Best Hardware of 2006,[227] and BAFTA's Best Innovation Award in 2007.[228] The Wii also broke several sales records and became one of the best-selling video game consoles of all time. As of March 31, 2021[update], it had sold over 101.64 million units worldwide,[229] surpassing its competitors PlayStation 3 (87.4 million) and Xbox 360 (84 million).[230] The Wii also had a significant cultural impact, as it introduced video games to a wider and more diverse audience, inspired new genres and modes of play, and influenced the development of motion controls in other platforms.[231]
