## Step 2: Extract the Updates
 
After downloading the updates, you need to extract them using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get two folders named SKIDROW and Update inside each update file. Copy these folders to the directory where you have installed Call of Duty Black Ops II. For example, if you have installed the game in C:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Call of Duty Black Ops II, copy the folders there.
 
## Step 3: Run the Updates
 
Now you need to run the updates to apply them to the game. Go to the Update folder and run the files named setup-1.bin and setup-2.bin for Update 1 and 2, and setup-3.bin for Update 3. Follow the instructions on the screen and wait for the updates to finish installing.
